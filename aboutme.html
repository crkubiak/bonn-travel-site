  Charles lives in Chicago, IL with his wife and <s>three</s> four cats.
  Charles's wife is a german citizen and grew up in the city of Bonn. She was
  kind enough to allow him to visit in August of 2018. Charles has been working
  tirelessly since returning from the trip to convince his wife to move back
  (and take him with her...)

  Phoenix, AZ where he started working in finance and acquired his first two
  cats. After the brokerage firm that Charles was working for purchased a firm
  in Chicago, IL he took the opportunity to relocate in 2012.

  This site was created as a final project for CIS-181 Web Development 1/Basic
  Web Technologies. The overall theme for this website was inspired by the
  famous <strong>Staatliches Bauhaus</strong> school of art. Below is a list of
  resources that I gathered to construct the site.
